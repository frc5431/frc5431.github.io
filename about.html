                Titan Robotics was founded in 2014 and we first participated in the 2015 FRC season.
                In our first 2 years as a team, we attended the FRC World Championships twice.
                In our first year as a team, we had no experience in robotics, few sponsors, and few mentors.
                In the 2015 season, we won the Rookie All-Star Award, an award given to the most promising new team at a regional competition.
                This award is not only for building a winning robot.
                Excelling at other aspects of the competition, like community outreach and education contribute to an FRC teamâ€™s greatness.
                This award won us a spot at the 2015 world championships.

                In our second year, we were finalists at the Dallas and Houston regionals.
                We won our spot to Championships at the Lone Star Regional in Houston.
                At Championships, we placed 16th out of 75 in our division at Championships.
                Throughout the season, over 50,000 people from across the world watched us compete.

                <p>
                In our third year, 2017, we went to Dallas and Waco regional,
                and got waitlisted into World Championships.
                At each competition we ended in Quarter finals.
                Then during the off season we competed in TRI, which we got to quarterfinals in.
                We also competed TRR, which we got semifinals at and were awarded with Team Spirit Award.
                We also, in cooperation with Chain Reaction, set up our own off-season event the North Texas Robotics Competition.
