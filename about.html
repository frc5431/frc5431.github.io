                <p>
                To have a successful team, you must have different values that you believe make a team successful,
                and use that to inform our actions. Our team values different things that is necessary for great teamwork.
                We have various different values such as honesty, respect, openness, and more. The decisions we make are
                based on these values and beliefs, and how we have great teamwork. 
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="column-flex" style="max-width: 40em;">
                <h2 class="center-vertically-self-flex">Respect</h2>
                <p>
                The reason why we value respect is because we follow the saying, “Treat others the way you want to be treated.”
                We must respect all our team members and treat them with kindness, and never look down on them.
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="column-flex" style="max-width: 40em;">
                <h2 class="center-vertically-self-flex">Honesty</h2>
                <p>
                Honesty is something we highly value because honesty helps a person conquer problems and excel in life.
                Honesty is what helps us build relationships with our members and expose our true self to each other.
                If we have a problem with someone or something, we express it to them to solve issues. 
                </p>

            <div class="column-flex" style="max-width: 40em;">
                <h2 class="center-vertically-self-flex">Openness</h2>
                <p>
                We value openness because openness is something that can really show others how someone is like and the ideas they have.
                If someone has a great idea but never tells us, we will never know. We don’t hold ideas and
                opinions back so we can collaborate more effectively.
                </p>

                <h2 class="center-vertically-self-flex">Teamwork</h2>
                <p>
                Teamwork is a necessary value for us because teamwork is collaborating together effectively to get things done.
                We all have different skills, and when we work together with these skills, we make something great.

                <h2 class="center-vertically-self-flex">Accountability</h2>
                <p>
                Accountability means to take responsibility of one's actions. Not having it means no one can be held responsible for the things we do.
                If something goes wrong because of a certain someone, they must say that it was their fault and acknowledge the fact they did something wrong. 
                </p>

                <h2 class="center-vertically-self-flex">Learning</h2>
                <p>
                When we learn, we acquire knowledge that can be very useful for activities. Learning is very important because it helps us gain knowledge
                and wisdom and to be a better team member. It can help us discover and build better things. We teach the rookies of our team everything
                we know, so that they can use that knowledge for the better. 
                </p>

            <div class="column-flex" style="max-width: 40em;">
                <h2 class="center-vertically-self-flex">Commitment</h2>
                <p>
                Being a member of our robotics team means that we each have a role and something to do to make this team better and fulfill our goals.
                We must fill that role and commit to whatever we’re supposed to do, and put 110% into everything we do to make it as best as possible.
                When we say we are going to finish something, we do. We must be in this team for a purpose, to do great things for this team.

                <h2 class="center-vertically-self-flex">2015</h2>
                <p>
                Titan Robotics was founded in 2014 and we first participated in the 2015 FRC season.
                In our first 2 years as a team, we attended the FRC World Championships twice.
                In our first year as a team, we had no experience in robotics, few sponsors, and few mentors.
                In the 2015 season, we won the Rookie All-Star Award, an award given to the most promising new team at a regional competition.
                This award is not only for building a winning robot.
                Excelling at other aspects of the competition, like community outreach and education contribute to an FRC team’s greatness.
                This award won us a spot at the 2015 world championships.

                <p>
                In our second year, we were finalists at the Dallas and Houston regionals.
                We won our spot to Championships at the Lone Star Regional in Houston.
                At Championships, we placed 16th out of 75 in our division at Championships.
                Throughout the season, over 50,000 people from across the world watched us compete.

                <p>
                In our third year, 2017, we went to Dallas and Waco regional,
                and got waitlisted into World Championships.
                At each competition we ended in Quarter finals.
                Then during the off season we competed in TRI, which we got to quarterfinals in.
                We also competed TRR, which we got semifinals at and were awarded with Team Spirit Award.
                We also, in cooperation with Chain Reaction, set up our own off-season event the North Texas Robotics Competition.
